    A generic object which implements the Token Bucket throttling algorithm.

    the original version of this which ran against DynamoDB), and incurs little
    to no impact on the pure memory version.

    The only method you should need (other than the constructor) is
    `Throttler.handle_event` which consumes a dictionary representing some
    input event that may or may not be throttled and returns a data dict with
    info about whether or not to throttle the request.
